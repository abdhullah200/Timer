This code is a simple stopwatch web application. It allows the user to start, stop, and reset a stopwatch with hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. Below is an explanation of how the code works:

   HTML (index.html)
This section defines the structure of the webpage.

   Head Section:

meta tags for setting the character encoding and viewport settings (responsive design).
The title of the page is set to "repl.it".
The link to the external CSS file (style.css) is included for styling.

   Body Section:

A container div holds the main elements, which include:
A heading (<h1>) displaying "STOPWATCH".
A div containing the stopwatch's time (<p class="time">), showing minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
Three buttons (START, STOP, RESET) with respective event handlers to control the stopwatch (e.g., onclick="start()").

   CSS (style.css)

This section defines the visual appearance of the webpage.

   General Styles:
   
body: Background color, font family, text alignment, and letter spacing are set for a clean and modern look.
.container: This class centers the stopwatch on the page both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox.
.main: Defines the style for the main stopwatch container with padding, margin, rounded corners, and a shadow for a card-like design. It also limits the minimum and maximum width of the container.
.time: The class for the time display, which sets the font size to 2rem.
Buttons: Styles for the buttons are set, including the background color, padding, rounded corners, font size, and hover/active effects like scaling the button and changing the shadow.
JavaScript (script.js)
This section controls the stopwatch's functionality, including the behavior of the buttons and the timing of the stopwatch.

   Variables:

milisec, sec, and min: These are references to the HTML elements displaying milliseconds, seconds, and minutes.
miliNum, secNum, minNum: These are counters for milliseconds, seconds, and minutes respectively.
INTERVAL: A variable to hold the interval ID for the setInterval function that controls the stopwatch's ticking.
   
   Functions:

 miliseconds():
This function increments the miliNum (milliseconds) counter by 1.
If the value is less than 10, it ensures the display is always in two digits (e.g., 01, 02, etc.).
When milliseconds reach 99, it resets to 0 and calls the seconds() function to increment the seconds.

 seconds():
This function increments the secNum (seconds) counter.
If seconds reach 59, it resets to 0 and calls the minutes() function to increment the minutes.

 minutes():
This function increments the minNum (minutes) counter.
It doesn't reset the minutes, as it's not handling any higher time units like hours in this case.

 start():
This function starts the stopwatch by clearing any existing intervals and setting a new interval that calls the miliseconds() function every 10 milliseconds.

stop():
This function stops the stopwatch by clearing the active interval.

 reset():
This function stops the stopwatch, clears the interval, and resets the counters (miliNum, secNum, minNum) back to 0. The time display is also reset to "00:00:00".
